# MACHINE-LEARNING-2-PROJECT
# KISAN BANDHU
#### A simple ML and DL based application which recommends the best crop to grow, fertilizers to use and the diseases caught by your crops.


## WHY KISAN BANDHU?
- One of the key industries that affects a nation's economic development is agriculture.

- The majority of people in countries like India rely on agriculture for their livelihood. Numerous new technologies are being incorporated into agriculture to make it simpler for farmers to cultivate and increase their production, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

- In this project, I show an UI that integrates three applications: one for crop suggestion, one for fertiliser recommendation, and one for plant disease prediction.

-One of the key industries that affects a nation's economic development is agriculture.

- The user can input their own soil data into the crop recommendation application, and the programme will then forecast which crop the user should produce.

- The user enters the soil data and the sort of crop they are growing into the fertiliser suggestion application, and the programme predicts what the soil lacks or has too much of and suggests adjustments.

- The programme will identify the disease, give some background information, and suggest potential remedies if the user uploads a photo of a diseased plant leaf to the application's plant disease prediction tool.

## How to use ðŸ’»
- Enter the corresponding nutrient levels for your soil, state, and city in the crop recommendation system. Keep in mind that the values for nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (N-P-K) should be entered as a ratio.

- Fertilizer recommendation system Enter the crop you want to plant together with the amount of nutrients in your soil. The algorithm will indicate which nutrient the soil is deficient in or has a surplus of. It will therefore offer advice on where to buy fertiliser.

- System for Detecting Disease ==> Post a photo of a leaf from your plant. The algorithm will indicate the type of crop and whether it is healthy or unhealthy. If it has a disease, it will explain what caused it and offer suggestions for treatment or prevention.
Be aware that it currently only supports the following crops.
Apple, Blueberry, Cherry, Corn, Grape, Pepper, Orange, Peach, Potato, Soybean, Strawberry, Tomato, Squash, Raspberry.
